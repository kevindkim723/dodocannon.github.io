      <p> Branching straight out from the Stevens Creek Reservoir and at the heart of the south bay, Montebello Rd snakes through the cupertino vineyards offering fantastic views of the lower bay/alviso area. If you look close enough past the apple UFO, the bay bridge will be visible on a clear day. This road hits close to home for Kevin's cycling story, as it was his first "real" climb. The variety of this climb is what distinguishes it from others </p>
