      <p> Kevin first accidentally stumbled into this climb while biking around with Mark, a good friend of his. Mark wanted to explore up the roads that led to his old house, which required going up bohlman road. Ever since then, this has been their go-to climb given that the sky isn't falling apart or the weather god is sweating bullets. </p>
